üöÄ Let's finish up
==============

Now that you have all the configuration files copied and configured, let's go ahead and test your graphQL service.
We recommend you use an external API design tool for testing, like Insomnia.

## Step 01
First off, let's start-up the Kong runtime instance (dataplane):

```bash
kong start -c kong.conf
```

## Step 02
You can find your hostname by running the following command:

```bash
echo $HOSTNAME.$_SANDBOX_ID.instruqt.io
```

Alternatively, you can test the service by running the following curl command:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/query \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'kong-debug: true' \
  --data '{"query":"{\n  country(code: \"AU\") {\n    name\n    native\n    capital\n    emoji\n    currency\n    languages {\n      code\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}"}'|jq
  ```
